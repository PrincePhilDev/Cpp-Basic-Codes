# C++ Programming Foundations: Building Strong Logic

This directory showcases my foundational work in core programming, logic, and data structures. Having a strong base in C++ was the launchpad for quickly mastering HTML/CSS and frontend problem-solving.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

My extensive C++ work is summarized by the technical areas mastered:

| Skill Focus | Key Competencies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** | Mastery of Classes, Objects, Inheritance, and Encapsulation principles. |
| **Data Structures** | Implementation and effective use of foundational structures (Arrays, Vectors). |
| **Problem Solving & Logic** | Development of efficient algorithms for various console applications and utilities. |
| **Input/Output (I/O) & Debugging** | Expertise in file handling, error detection, and robust command-line interface design. |

## How to Compile and Run

These projects are command-line applications. To run them, you will need a C++ compiler (like g++).

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/PrincePhilDev/Cpp-Basic-Codes`
2. Compile the file: `g++ project_name.cpp -o executable_name`
3. Run the program: `./executable_name`
